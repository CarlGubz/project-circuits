        <h2> Theory</h2>
        <p>In electric circuits analysis, nodal analysis, node-voltage analysis, or the branch current  method
            <br> is a method of determining the voltage (potential difference) between "nodes" (points where elements
            <br>  or branches connect) in an electrical circuit in terms of the branch currents. 
        </p>
        
        <!--How?-->
        <p>
                In analyzing a circuit using Kirchhoff's circuit laws, one can either do nodal analysis using Kirchhoff's  
            <br> current law (KCL) or mesh analysis using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Nodal analysis writes an equation 
            <br> at each electrical node, requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch  
            <br> currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation             
            <br> must give current as a function of voltage; an admittance representation. For instance, for a resistor,  
            <br>  Ibranch = Vbranch * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of theresistor.

        <h2> Procedures </h2>
        <p>Step 1. Note all connected wire segments in the circuit. These are the nodes of nodal analysis.</p>
        <p>Step 2. Select one node as the ground reference. The choice does not affect the result and is just a 
            <br> matter of convention. Choosing the node with the most connections can simplify the analysis. 
            <br> For a circuit of N nodes the number of nodal equations is Nâˆ’1</p>
        <p>Step 3. Assign a variable for each node whose voltage is unknown. If the voltage is already known, 
            <br> it is not necessary to assign a variable.</p>
        <p>Step 4. For each unknown voltage, form an equation based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (i.e. add together 
            <br> all currents leaving from the node and mark the sum equal to zero). The current between two nodes 
            <br> is equal to the node with the higher potential minus the node with the lower potential, both divided 
            <br> by the resistance between the two nodes.</p>
        <p>Step 5. If there are voltage sources between two unknown voltages, join the two nodes as a supernode. The 
            <br> currents of the two nodes are combined in a single equation, and a new equation for the voltages is formed.</p>
        <p>Step 6. Solve the system of simultaneous equations for each unknown voltage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
        <h2> Supernodes</h2>
            <p>In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V1 and V2. The voltage at V3 is already known to be VB 
                <br> because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential. </p> 

            <p>   The current going through voltage source VA cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we cannot write the current 
                <br> equations for either V1 or V2. However, we know that the same current leaving node V2 must enter node V1. Even though 
                <br> the nodes cannot be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining  
                <br> of the two nodes is called the supernode technique, and it requires one additional equation: V1 = V2 + VA.</p>
